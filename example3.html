        This example is about making lists
    </h1>
        <p>
            Here's what I like about lists:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
                </li>
                <li>
                    That's about it
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm gunna put another list item here because doing thigns in threes is cool
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you make a list, do it in this order:
        </p>
            <ol>
                 <li>
                     Decide if it's an ordered list or not
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    If it's not a ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
                </li>
                <li>
                     Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                <ul>
                    Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You've got this, I believe in you! 
                 </li>
            </ol>
